# Predicting the survivors of the Titanic

In this repository you will find the code that I used to create machine learning models for the Titanic problem.
This project had two main purposes: 

1. To get more familiar with machine learning and the usage of the available algorithms
2. To analyze the accuracy and speed of the different algorithms

Note that the results while not bad, could be better because I purposely did only limited pre-processing on the data-set.
Together with the problem not being complex enough this is most likely also the reason that when optimized, most models have around the same accuracy.

# Reflection

The Titanic dataset posed a nice resource for my goals as it is not very complex and has been done a lot of times, thus there were a lot of resources to guide me in my journey.  
While this was beneficial as my first project, it is a bit unfortunate that we were not able to see a lot of difference in the algorithms though.
Therefore my next project will be on a more complex problem.  
I also learned that it likely returns better results to optimize the dataset rather than the model, although both would be best ofcourse.
